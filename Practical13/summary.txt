The explain of the code
1. Read data from the BLOSUM62 matrix.
2. Implement a simple global alignment algorithm for comparing two protein sequences.
3. Calculate the score for each alignment and determine the percentage of the same amino acids.
4. The similarity of three sets of sequences (human-mouse, human-rat, mouse-rat) was analyzed.
5. Based on the results of the analysis, determine which rodent is a better model for studying human SLC6A4 gene variants.


finding:By calculating the BLOSUM62 score and the percentage of identical amino acids, we quantified the similarity between the sequences.
Based on BLOSUM62 scores, the SLC6A4 gene sequence of mouse showed the highest similarity to that of humans, suggesting that mouse may be a good model organism for studying human SLC6A4 gene variation.
